# YG System

This project is still in progress, it is for a youth group to help them with their processes, explained below.

The system revolves around students that have a unique ID assigned to them (In regards to the youth group, it is rfid cards with unique ID's).

## What's inside
### Bank
The student can:
- Deposit Kudos (currency name)
- Withdraw Kudos
- Find out their balance

### Attendance
This is where the system registers the student's weekly attendance in three different services: Sunday school, bible study, summer club.
With Each attendance, the student gets a small amount of kudos added to their bank account as an incentive. Consecutive attendance has it's own bonuses as well.

### Admin
This is where students can be added, cards can be changed/upgraded to more perks and so on.
